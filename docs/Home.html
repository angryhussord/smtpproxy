<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Most mail servers require encrypted connections (SSL/TLS), but not all software supports SSL/TLS. SmtpProxy accepts unencrypted connections, encrypts them,&nbsp;and forwards them to your SMTP server. It runs as a Windows Service and supports ALL email clients.
 It's developed in C#/.NET4.</p>
<p>SmtpProxy supports GMail, Yahoo,&nbsp;Microsoft Live Mail/Hotmail, and Microsoft Office 365. SmtpProxy supports any and all email clients including Outlook, Firebird, Kaspersky Administration Kit, etc.</p>
<p>SmtpProxy supports installation on a single Windows computer for email clients on that computer only. SmtpProxy also supports installation on a Windows Server so that all computers on your network can route mail through SmtpProxy.</p>
<p>The <a href="/releases">SMTP Proxy Installer</a> does not prompt for any information nor does it provide any confirmation after installation is complete.&nbsp; It installs the software, registers the Windows Service, and gets to work.&nbsp; See the
<a href="/documentation">documentation</a> for more information.</p>
