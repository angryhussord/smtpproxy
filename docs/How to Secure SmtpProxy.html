<h2>Is SmtpProxy a Security Hole?</h2>
<p>If not configured and accessed correctly, SmtpProxy could create a security hole that Evil Spammers could take advantage of.&nbsp; The reason that most SMTP Servers require an encrypted connection is to make it very difficult for the Evil Spammers to steal
 your password.&nbsp; Once they have your password, they can start sending billions of emails of dubious value.</p>
<p>The worst part of this, aside from the billions of unwanted emails, is that your email provider will probably punish you by suspending your email account.&nbsp; What else can they do?&nbsp; As far as your email provider can tell, you&rsquo;ve become an Evil
 Spammer and suspending your account is The Right Thing To Do.</p>
<p>So, can SmtpProxy be used safely? Absolutely.&nbsp; Like most tools, it comes down to understanding what you&rsquo;re doing and knowing what to look out for.</p>
<h2>Security Starts with Good Borders</h2>
<p>SmtpProxy is really no different than any other software that communicates over the Internet.&nbsp; In order to be sure it is not misused you must have good borders.&nbsp; These borders are usually called firewalls.</p>
<p>Firewalls come in all different sizes and shapes.&nbsp; Some firewalls are simply software programs that monitor network traffic in and out of your computer.&nbsp; Windows has had a very useful firewall built into it for many years now.</p>
<p>Other firewalls are built into hardware like network routers.&nbsp; Wherever, they are located firewalls prevent certain traffic from entering your computer or network.</p>
<p>If you make sure that only trusted computers and programs can access SmtpProxy, then you can feel confident that you are not exposing your email password.</p>

<h2>Option 1: Install SmtpProxy on the Email Client</h2>
<p>This is the easiest and safest way to use SmtpProxy.&nbsp; Follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install SmtpProxy on the same computer as the Email Client </li><li>Configure SmtpProxy to listen on a non-standard port such as 7000 </li><li>Make sure you have a software firewall configured to block any connections on port 7000
</li></ul>
<p>To test this setup, simply try to connect to SmtpProxy from another computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option 2: Install SmtpProxy on an internal network</h2>
<p>This is easier if you have quite a few client computers and you want all of them to be able to use SmtpProxy.&nbsp; Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install SmtpProxy on a computer that everyone on your network can access </li><li>Configure SmtpProxy to listen on a non-standard port such as 7000 </li><li>Make sure you have a software firewall configured to only accept connections on port 7000 from computers on your local network
</li><li>For even better security, use a hardware firewall/router that prevents outside computers from connecting to your network on port 7000
</li></ul>
<p>To test this setup, try to connect to SmtpProxy from a computer outside of your network.</p>
